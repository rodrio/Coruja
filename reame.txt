Developed to help sysadmins to follow vulnerabilities RSS feeds. Based on a key word list, it parses multiple feeds, to build a compilation of information containing only what matters to the sysadmin.

Current version: v0.1-rc1

Next steps:
- Treat non-standard feeds: feeds that don't have the items separated by tags <item> and </item> in XML
- System is currently returning TXT file: prepare the system to return XML file with the compilation
- Treat input files: use tag # for comments in input files and ignore blank lines
- Treat input files: verify if links are valid XML resources before performing any actions
